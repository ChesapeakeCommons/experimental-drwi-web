          <p><strong>ADDITIONAL METRIC INFORMATION</strong></p>

          <p>
            <strong>Impervious area draining to BMP (sf):</strong> The impervious area contributing runoff to the bioretention area with units in square feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Area draining to the BMP (DA, sf):</strong> The total drainage area contributing runoff to the bioretention area with units in square feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Runoff volume captured (EP, acre-ft):</strong> This is the total runoff volume stored in the bioretention area as calculated by the state-specific Engineering Parameter (EP) in acre-feet (CSN, 2015).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rainfall depth Treated (RT, inches</strong> This is the depth of rainfall treated by the BMP in inches, as calculated by the formula RT = EP*12/(IA/43560), as described in CSN (2015).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>USWG Adjustor Curve Efficiencies (%):</strong> These are the CBP USWG Runoff Reduction (RR) efficients for new retrofits, acalutated as a function of RT (CSN, 2013b).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Area of the BMP (sf):</strong> This is the area of the BMP itself, typically measured as length times width in square feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No. of observed bird or small animal species:</strong> As your bioretention area matures, count the number of bird and other animal species that begin to populate the area Sellner et al., 2012, pp.160-161.
