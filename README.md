## Getting Started (Developers)

### Installing Dependencies

Install NPM and BOWER if they are not already installed.

    npm install

    bower install

Running those two commands in Terminal will download and install all of the necessary dependencies to run this application.


###

To start a local development server at ````http://127.0.0.1:8080```` we will need to run one more command in the Terminal:

    gulp serve

This will start the local development server and automatically open a new window with the Application running.
